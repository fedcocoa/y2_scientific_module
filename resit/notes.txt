setup input equations
setup resolution and the matrix of a+bi inputs
setup the answers matrix which stores the return values

use loop to calculate each result from the a+bi inputs
store the values in the answers matrix

figure out which values from the a+bi didn't converge
find the minimum and maximum of those values

use loop to check which values were roots
could definitely change this to be faster

reshape the roots matrix into an array
split then into real and imaginary to use with the unique tolerance function
then recombine to make complex numbers again

generate a list of hsv values
range the hue values between 0 and 1 using however many steps are needed for unique colours
convert the colours from the hsv space to rgb to be used for the image

create the colour image matrix

split up the uniques into real and imaginary to use with the is member tolerance
definitely problems with this not working at the moment

loop through all of the colours
check the flat roots array against the current colour using ismembertol
reshape the logical matrix
use the logical matrix as a mask to set the colours
